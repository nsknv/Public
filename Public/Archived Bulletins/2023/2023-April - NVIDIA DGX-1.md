### Details


This section provides a summary of potential vulnerabilities that this security update addresses and their impact. Descriptions use [CWE™](https://cwe.mitre.org/), and base scores and vectors use [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) standards.




| \*\*CVE ID\*\* | \*\*Description\*\* | \*\*Base Score\*\* | \*\*Vector\*\* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE‑2023‑0209 | NVIDIA DGX-1 SBIOS contains a vulnerability in the Uncore PEI module, where authentication of the code executed by SSA is missing, which may lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, data tampering, and SecureBoot bypass. | 8.2 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2023‑25505 | NVIDIA DGX-1 BMC contains a vulnerability in the IPMI handler of the AMI MegaRAC BMC, where an attacker with the appropriate level of authorization can cause a buffer overflow, which may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution. | 7.8 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2023‑25506 | NVIDIA DGX-1 contains a vulnerability in Ofbd in AMI SBIOS, where a preconditioned heap can allow a user with elevated privileges to cause an access beyond the end of a buffer, which may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, denial of service and information disclosure. The scope of the impact of this vulnerability can extend to other components. | 7.5 | [AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2023‑25507 | NVIDIA DGX-1 BMC contains a vulnerability in the SPX REST API, where an attacker with the appropriate level of authorization can inject arbitrary shell commands, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering. | 7.2 | [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2023‑25508 | NVIDIA DGX-1 BMC contains a vulnerability in the IPMI handler, where an attacker with the appropriate level of authorization can upload and download arbitrary files under certain circumstances, which may lead to denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering. | 6.7 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)H |
| CVE‑2023‑25509 | NVIDIA DGX-1 SBIOS contains a vulnerability in Bds, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, and escalation of privileges. | 6.0 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H) |
